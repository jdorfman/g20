g20 (Generate a 20 Character Password) is the fastest and easiest cross-platform CLI password generator on the planet.  For years I have been using [something similar to it](https://medium.com/@jdorfman/osx-password-generator-in-bash-48687892c4f3#.ex5p9qiig) but it only works on OS X.  Today that is no longer the case.  All you need to do now is run:

`npm install -g g20`

### FAQ's

> Can I generate a password **longer** than 20 characters?

No.

> Can I generate a password **shorter** than 20 characters?

No.

> Can I customize the background color to my liking?

No.

**Bottom line**: all customizations require a fork.
