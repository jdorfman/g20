g20 v1.0.3-beta
====

g20 (Generate a 20 Character Password) is the fastest and easiest cross-platform CLI password generator on the planet.  For years I have been using [something similar to it](https://medium.com/@jdorfman/osx-password-generator-in-bash-48687892c4f3#.ex5p9qiig) but it only works on OS X.  During the beta I ask others to help test other OS platforms.

### Installation
`npm install -g g20`

### Usage

```
$ g20

> Can I generate a password **longer** than 20 characters?

No.

No.

> Can I customize the background color to my liking?

**Bottom line**: all customizations require a fork.
